## bshuffle - bandcamp shuffle
bshuffle is a chrome extension for playing bandcamp albums online at the at the album webpage in a random order, because for some reason that isn't possible.

## installation
i'm poor and can't put it on the webstore.  download the whole folder somewhere and load it as an unpacked extension.  you can delete the h folder.

## usage
the extension if properly installed will deploy a shuffle button below the play button of bandcamp url albums (\*.bandcamp.\*/album/\*).  click this and it will begin playing albums in a shuffled order, marking the list of songs with a checkmark as they finished.  Click on the next button to proceed skip a song.  If you play another song manually it will not count as if the randomiser played it and it may be played again. I could change this but I don't feel like it.
